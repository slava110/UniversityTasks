UniversityTasks

Simple C++ project for my university tasks. CUI to execute tasks included

<=== How to use it? ===>
1. Start program (use Main.cpp as entry point file)
2. Enter task id
3. Provide user input (if needed)
4. Wait for task to execute
5. After task execution you can either rerun task (using `R` button on your keyboard) or press any other button to return to the main menu
6. When you're done you can exit program using `exit` command (or just press big red cross, yeah)

<=== Task ids ===>
For first 4 homeworks use `<homework number>.<task number>` format.
For example, to execute task 'Cone' you should use `2.1` as task id, to execute task 'Filter' you should use `3.4`, etc.

To execute homework 5 tasks use english task names:
- euclid
- eratosthene
- textFiles (this task will execute both required tasks at once (12 and 13))
- rows.1 (rows #13)
- rows.2 (rows #19)
- files (files #25)

To execute 'Balls' task use `balls` task id
To execute 'Structural numbers' task use `miraculousNums` task id
To execute 'Spinners' tasks use `spinners.<task number>` format. (`spinners.1`, `spinners.2`, etc.)
